Hello people.Thanks a bunch for being here. This is our first project as students, and represents an ecommerce focused in bringing together medium-small wine producers and consumers. You might be wondering which programming language we used for our project. Well ,let me tell you that we used Java for the back-end, Spring boot framework, and of course HTML, CSS and JS on the front-end. The project is based on three types of users: Clients, Wine producers and Web administrators. Every user has a profile page where they can access information, add products, see purchases, modify data, ect. To register as a client you must be +18. Only client users can purchase products. The purchase must be approved by administrators. Session times out after a time of inactivity.  When you login you'll be reminded of any pending purchase you may have still not completed. You can cancel the purchase or proceed to checkout. While a purchase is ongoing, stock of selected products will be blocked until the purchase is completed, canceled or not approved by administrators. A second login will logout the previous one. More features to be added soon.
